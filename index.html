                        BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock.

                        JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a client-side
                        scripting language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript is often used in
                        conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic, user-friendly websites. It is also used to build mobile applications and can be
                        utilized on the server-side through the use of runtime environments such as Node.js. Some of the key features of JavaScript include
                        its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in order to change the appearance of a webpage, as well as its support
                        for object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Overall, JavaScript is an essential tool for any web developer.

                        Smoking is harmful to your health in many ways. It can cause cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic
                        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can also cause premature aging and can damage your teeth and gums. Smoking can also harm
                        the health of those around you, through secondhand smoke. In addition, smoking is expensive and can be a financial burden. It can
                        also lead to addiction and is difficult to quit. The best way to protect your health and the health of those around you is to never
                        start smoking or to quit if you do smoke.

                        Ecommerce, or electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. It has revolutionized
                        the way we shop, making it easier and more convenient to purchase products from anywhere in the world. Ecommerce platforms, such as
                        online marketplaces or merchant websites, allow businesses to sell their products directly to consumers. In addition to traditional
                        retail products, ecommerce also includes the sale of digital goods such as music, movies, and software. Ecommerce has greatly
                        expanded the reach of businesses, allowing them to sell to a global market. It has also made it easier for consumers to compare
                        prices and find the best deals. Overall, ecommerce has greatly impacted the way we shop and do business.
